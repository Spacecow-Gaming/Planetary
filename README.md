Planetary
=========

Planetary was originally a board game, but isn't any more.

Priorities:
*  Create game prototype. Language, paradigms etc don't matter, as long as it works
*  Design a user-friendly UI of some sort
*  Things I've forgotten. They can't be that important if I've forgotten them, so I left them out
